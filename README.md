# Data Checker

The SCCWRP Flask app data checker which now uses more optimized code to check, which should allow for faster data checking. This checker application is basically a refactoring of the original checker application developed for bight2018 and the SMC regional monitoring programs. (That repository is private)
This repository is more or less a template to set up checker applications for different projects.
